title: WebAssembly (Wasm) Working Group Charter
---

## Background

WebAssembly, commonly known as Wasm, refers to a compact binary instruction format utilized by a stack-based virtual machine. Its primary purpose is to serve as a versatile compilation target for programming languages, enabling seamless deployment of applications for both client-side and server-side environments.

In the context of cloud native, and with the presence of a Wasm runtime, the portability and versatility of Wasm allow users to run workloads in a diverse set of environments in both a centralized location and at the edge, including but not limited to VMs running a single docker daemon, Kubernetes cluster, and any other compatible workload orchestrator.

## Mission Statement

The Wasm working group focuses on topics of running Wasm workloads across the edge, Kubernetes, and other cloud-native projects. The primary mission is to enable Wasm to be a first-class alternative to running such workloads. The secondary mission is to ensure Wasm is integrated and evolved across all cloud-native projects. We do so by promoting the adoption and usage of WebAssembly by providing resources, best practices, and tools that enable end users to utilize its unique benefits.

## Scope

The working group is interested in all topics related to building Wasm artifacts, packaging and distribution, and developing solutions that embrace Wasm, including:

- Developing and adjusting **infrastructure for Wasm deployments**. The cloud-native modifications to meet Wasm conditions. 
- Development and configuration of **wasm-specific workloads**. How do we start working with Wasm? How do we write,  deploy, test and debug our workloads to Wasm environments? How do we empower Wasm to those specific ML/AI workloads with a wide variety of AI HW accelerators? 
- Cloud-native **DevOps practices for Wasm** environments. How do we operate our workloads in Wasm deployment scenarios? Typical DevOps and Observability topics need to be adjusted to Wasm environments.
- **Interoperability** with other deployment types. Wasm workloads should be able to run in a pod alongside containers seamlessly.
- **Security** - Understanding, documenting, and educating folks on the security considerations of their WASM and WASI workloads and how to integrate WASM runtimes into their projects safely.
- **Wasm artifacts** - guide and document container registry storage structures to provide a basis for compatibility for container runtimes.

## Deliverables

The working group will build collaboration, knowledge, and projects in the Wasm space, including:
 			
- **Publications, presentations, and whitepapers** on interesting topics - the group will stay ahead of the current technology trends and provide material on the latest innovative topics in the space.
- **Example architectures and demos** - provides well-documented use cases using existing projects and demos that can be used as starting points for future projects.
- **Standards, tests, and certifications** - the working group will investigate if it is possible to certify solutions in well-defined domains against known criteria.
- **WebAssembly ecosystem proposals** - provide updates on the different open proposals and how they benefit the ecosystem. Collaborate and align with the community on the current and new proposals. 
- **Metrics** - provides guidelines for project planning in terms of resource usage.
- **Ecosystem updates** - provides updates on the landscape of cloud-native projects on the Wasm at conferences, in publications, and to the Runtime TAG.
- **Vertical Use cases** - provide documentation or code implementation of cloud-native wasm use cases in certain vertical scenarios (network, database, AI, embedding a Wasm runtime, etc.)
