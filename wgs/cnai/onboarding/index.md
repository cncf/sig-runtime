Welcome to the CNAI working group. If you are confused, or want to contribute, here are some recommended steps to get you started:

## Step 1: Read the White Paper

Start by reading the [white paper](https://tag-runtime.cncf.io/wgs/cnaiwg/whitepapers/cloudnativeai/) on Cloud-Native AI to gain a comprehensive understanding of problems/opportunities and the foundation work done by the working group.

## Step 2: Check the Most Recent Posts on the WG Blog

Review the [most recent posts](https://tag-runtime.cncf.io/blog/) on the Cloud-Native AI blog for updates and announcements.

## Step 3: Explore Previous Discussions

* Look into the [notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tS6gL5qjGLaHDtAChssqJhBVm8BIpopUA3Ddzm9LHwg/edit) from previous discussions to get a sense of the group's activities and interests. Videos are also available for a deeper dive, if desired.
* Check the latest discussions in the #wg-artificial-intelligence channel on [CNCF Slack](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C05TYJE81SR).

## Step 4: Identify an Existing Topic of Interest

Based on the notes, identify a topic of interest that aligns with your expertise or interests. If you find something that resonates with you, post a message on Slack to let the group know.

## Step 5: Bring New Topics/Suggestions

If you found an area you are interested in,  feel free to bring it up.  There is really a wide scope within cloud native AI.  Example process for new topic could go like the following:

* Start something (a doc, code, share a project, etc).
* Share with the community (e.g. in Slack - https://cloud-native.slack.com#wg-artificial-intelligence).
* Set a tentative target date and deliverables.
* Gather critical mass (Some things could be done solo)
* Execute (hopefully with critical mass).
* Share the outcome (community, kubecon, other conferences, etc)

As a group we are trying to converge into a roadmap to produce useful artifacts for the community. Here is a proposal on roadmap/approach:

* [Address topics highlighted in the Perform section](https://tag-runtime.cncf.io/blog/cnai-kubecon-eu-paris-2024-recap/#perform), parallelize as a group to produce content (could be sections or dedicated writeups) related to different AI topics.
  * What is the impact of AI on sustainability, and how are we going to use cloud-native to build AI/ML applications responsibly?
  * What is the impact of cloud native AI on businesses?
  * How to evolve the cloud native ecosystem, especially Kubernetes, to address issues around scheduling and batch workloads?
  * How to improve inference speed?
  * How to evaluate AI/ML applications?
  * How to monitor, observe, and signal issues for AI/ML?
  * â€¦
* Reference the **personas** related for each topic as well to make it more actionable.
* Use the content we produce + the white paper as data for our [use-case / reference architecture recommender LLM](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C05TYJE81SR/p1712235144103149). Also use it for the CNAI [knowledge LLM](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L-gP001biKswpLTX6X0iC2QfLZHBESPpa-VA3KfbhXU/edit).
* In parallel we are working on the CNAI Radar and the CNAI sub-landscape.

## Step 6: Join the Twice Monthly Online Meetings

Last but not least, do try to attend the twice montly meetings to stay connected with the group, engage in discussions, and contribute to existing or new projects/initiatives. Add the CNCF calendar for call details which also includes the date/time for AI working group meetings: [https://www.cncf.io/calendar/](https://www.cncf.io/calendar/).

We currently meet the 2nd and 4th Friday at 8 am pst.

Join Slack at https://cloud-native.slack.com then channel #wg-artificial-intelligence.

## Step 7: Join the mailing list

Most of the discussion is happening on a slack, but the mailing list is an additional veneue where asynchronus discussions can happen as well. You can subscribe [here](https://lists.cncf.io/g/wg-artificial-intelligence).
